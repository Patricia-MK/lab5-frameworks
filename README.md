# Tools Used & Our Experience
Bootstrap
We used Bootstrap to quickly build a responsive page layout using the grid system.  
Allowing us to style the navbar, alerts, buttons, and layout without writing any custom CSS.  
Experience: It was easy to implement and good for structured design. We appreciated the ready-made components.

# Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS was used to build a card-style layout using utility-first classes like `bg-white`, `rounded`, `shadow`, etc.  
We focused on creating a clean section with a headline, list, and call-to-action button.  
Experience: Tailwind gave us more flexibility but required more attention to layout and spacing. We enjoyed the precise control.

# React.js
We built an interactive React app using components and hooks. A `Team` component received a name via `props`, and a toggle button showed/hid team members using `useState()`.  
Experience: React made managing UI states easier. It was different from traditional HTML/JS but fun to use with JSX and components.
